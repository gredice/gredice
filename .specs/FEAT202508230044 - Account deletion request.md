# Account deletion request

Status: Draft

In-game account deletion requests can be initiated by the user through the settings menu. The user must confirm the deletion by entering their password. Then email is sent to them just like we do when deleting through the administration application (app).

Before deletion, user must be only user on the account. Other users must be removed. This check should be displayed above the delete account button to inform user this is the requirement. In future there may be other requirenments so make sure we can list multiple. If requirenment is not met - user should be informed about it and the deletion process should not be allowed.
